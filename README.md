# taskboard v1.0

Live page: http://lukaslanger.bplaced.net/taskboard/

### Introduction and Overview
I started this project in august 2020. At this time I became familiar with the kanban process and started using some of the sites, but there were some points that I didn't like about the site and I also wanted to be independent. At the beginning it was very straightforward and had hardly any features, but this changed faster and faster, so that the site that I wanted to develop in order to manage my projects quickly became a project of its own.

This taskboard application will give you the ability to:
- create tasks, mangage appointments, create to-do lists 
- create groups to work on tasks together
- create and manage appointments for your group or your own
- use a messageboard to share important things with your group
- create to-do lists for your own
- create morningroutine tasks
- weather panel

### Task

Every task belongs to a group. On the starting page you can see which tasks of the group are open, in progress and finished.
- There is a day counter to see how long is task is open, or to see for how many days someone is working on it.
- Also when it is in progress you can see who is working on it, by default it is shorten by the first 3 letters of the username, but can be changed in the settings
- You can set up after how many days a task gets moved to the archive after finished
- UPDATE you can configure your own labels to split up tasks even more. (eg. in progress, review pending, delayed)

### Taskdetails

UPDATE the whole design got refectored, so now it looks way more attractive and the alligntment is mathematical correkt

I did that panel to protect myself from procrastination. You set to-do's and are only able to work them off first in first out.

### Timetable Panel

You can plan your whole week. Also in the next Week you can build up on the timetable from the last week, so there is no need to add every entries every week.
