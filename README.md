# taskboard v1.0

Working page: http://lukaslanger.bplaced.net/taskboard/

### Introduction and Overview
I started this project in august 2020. At this time I became familiar with the kanban process and started using some of the sites, but there were some points that I didn't like about the site and I also wanted to be independent. At the beginning it was very straightforward and had hardly any features, but this changed faster and faster, so that the site that I wanted to develop in order to manage my projects quickly became a project of its own.

This taskboard application will give you the ability to:
*create tasks, mangage appointments, create to-do lists 
*create groups to work on tasks together
*create and manage appointments for your group or your own
*use a messageboard to share important things with your group
*create to-do lists for your own
*create repeating tasks on a weekly base

### Task

Every task belongs to a group. On the starting page you can see which tasks of the group are open, in progress and finished.
*There is a day counter to see how long is task is open, or to see for how many days someone is working on it.
*Also when it is in progress you can see who is working on it, by default it is shorten by the first 3 letters of the username, but can be changed in the settings
*You can set up after how many days a task gets moved to the archive after finished

### Message Board Panel

On the messageboard panel you can create and will see messages. A message is belonging to a group so you have one board where you will see all messages from the groups you belong to.

### Appointment Panel

On the Appointment Panel you can manage your appointments and deadlines. They are automatically deleted after that day.

### Queue Panel

I did that panel to protect myself from procrastination. You set to-do's and are only able to work them off first in first out.
